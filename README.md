**Introduction**<br><br>
The rise of online commerce has revolutionized the way we conduct transactions, offering
unparalleled convenience and accessibility. However, this convenience comes with its share of
risks, as online payment platforms become targets for fraudulent activities. From credit card fraud
to identity theft, the digital realm presents numerous challenges for ensuring the security of
financial transactions.
In response to these threats, organizations are increasingly turning to machine learning techniques
to fortify their defenses against online payment fraud. By harnessing the power of data analytics
and advanced algorithms, these systems aim to detect suspicious activities, identify fraudulent
patterns, and mitigate potential risks in real-time.
This essay explores the role of machine learning in online payment fraud detection, outlining key
strategies, techniques, and considerations involved in building effective fraud detection systems.
From data collection and preprocessing to model training and deployment, we delve into the
intricacies of leveraging machine learning to safeguard digital transactions and preserve the trust
of consumers and businesses alike.
