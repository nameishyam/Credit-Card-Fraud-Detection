**Abstract**
Online payment fraud poses a significant threat to the integrity of digital transactions, necessitating effective detection mechanisms to safeguard businesses and consumers. In response, machine learning techniques have emerged as a promising approach for enhancing fraud detection capabilities. This literature survey explores the landscape of online payment fraud detection using machine learning, drawing insights from a variety of research sources. We examine methodologies, techniques, and advancements in the field, covering topics such as data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation metrics. By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges and opportunities in online payment fraud detection. This abstract serves as a roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage machine learning for bolstering the security of digital transactions and preserving trust in online commerce
